# DeepRitz&ls

## Implementation of the Deep Ritz method and the Least Square method

Three problems are solved using the Deep Ritz method, see 2dpoisson.py, 2dpoisson-hole.py, and 10dpoisson.py. Three problems are solved using the least square functional, see 2dpoisson-ls.py, 2dpoisson-hole-ls.py, and 10dpoisson-ls.py.
